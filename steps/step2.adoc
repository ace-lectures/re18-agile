= Step #2: Define a Sprint Backlog

We will develop our product in Java. If you have followed the _prerequisites_ step, you should have this code on your computer, an the `agile-tutorial` directory.

Our product contains the following stories, making it minimal:

* As _Bob_ (the poker player), I want to give my hand's content to the croupier so that I can participate to the game;
* As _Alice_ (the croupier), I want to check the absence of card duplicates in an hand so that I can detect cheaters.

[TIP]
====
* Identify in your product backlog a story (or a set of stories) to develop to transform this _minimal product_ into a _minimal and viable_ one.
* Is there a way to trace these stories w.r.t. the source code?
