# Organizer's guide


## Room organization

  - The room must fit the number of participants, who will work as pairs. 
  - They must be able to use their laptops, so electric plugs should be available
  - The demo requires to download artefacts from a remote server. The Wifi connection should support that.

## Preparing the printed material

  - Print the `agile_planning_pokerA4RV.pdf` file on A4/Letter paper, recto-verso. Cut the card decks to have one set 
    per participants. 
      - One might consider buying an existing card game (usually containing 4 card decks). 
      - I am using the  one produced by [MountainGoat](https://store.mountaingoatsoftware.com/products/planning-poker-cards), 
        costing less than $1 per participant.
  - Print the `story_cards_A4RV.pdf` file on  A4/Letter paper, recto-verso. Cut the cards to have ~10 cards per 
    participants. They usually consumes less, but preparing some extras helps, and it can be reused in the next 
    instance of the tutorial.
    
 ## Cue sheet
 
 The tutorial is built as a 3 hours session, including a break (from 15 to 30 minutes) in the middle. In the following 
 cue sheet:
  
   - `T0` is the starting time, thus `T0+45` means 45 minutes after the start of the tutorial.
   - `T1` is the return time of the break, should be equal to `T0+105` for a 15' break, and `T0+120` for a 30' one.
